Schema-free: It allows you to store data without the need for any predefined schema, which makes it easier to work with dynamic data.
Real-time: It provides real-time data synchronization, which means that any changes made to the database are instantly reflected in all the connected devices.
Low development cost: It is very easy to use, which reduces the development cost and time.
High performance: It has a high-performance indexing engine that provides fast data retrieval and indexing.
Easy to scale: It provides horizontal scaling, which makes it easy to scale up or down depending on the needs of the application.
